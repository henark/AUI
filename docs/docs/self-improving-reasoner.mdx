title: Architecture for a Self-Improving Reasoner
---

This document outlines a proposed architecture for a self-improving reasoning system, designed to be integrated into a larger AI agent. The core idea is to create a system that learns from its own experience, using the `llm-reasoners` library as its planning component.

### High-Level Design

We can design the self-improvement capability as a continuous feedback loop with several key components:

**1. Experience Logger (Trace Recorder)**
For every task, this component will automatically log the entire reasoning trace. This is more than just the final answer; it's the *process*.
*   **What it logs:**
    *   The initial problem and goal.
    *   The full search tree explored by the `llm-reasoners` algorithm (MCTS, BFS, etc.).
    *   The sequence of actions in the final chosen plan.
    *   The intermediate results from the Execution Layer after each action.
    *   The final outcome (success or failure).

**2. Automated Outcome Assessor**
After a task is complete, this module evaluates its success.
*   **How it works:** It can use a combination of methods:
    *   **Programmatic Checks:** Does the final state match the goal criteria? (e.g., "Does the file 'summary.txt' exist?").
    *   **LLM-based Evaluation:** For more subjective goals, another LLM can be used to compare the final output against the original request (e.g., "Does this summary accurately reflect the web page content?").
    *   **Human-in-the-loop:** The system could occasionally ask a human for feedback on its performance.

**3. Training Data Pipeline**
This is an offline process that periodically takes the logged experiences and transforms them into high-quality training data.
*   **For Fine-tuning the Base LLM:** It would extract all successful reasoning traces (the step-by-step thoughts and actions) and format them for instruction-tuning. This teaches the LLM to "think" more like its successful past self.
*   **For Training a Reward Model:** It would create data points of the form `(state, action) -> outcome_reward`. This data is used to train a model that can predict how good a particular move is, making the search process much more efficient in the future.

**4. Model Training & Validation Engine**
This component takes the prepared datasets and runs the training jobs.
*   **Fine-tuning:** It fine-tunes the base `LanguageModel` on successful traces.
*   **Reward Model Training:** It trains a separate reward model using techniques from Reinforcement Learning.
*   **Validation:** Before deploying a newly trained model, it must be benchmarked against a standard set of problems to ensure it hasn't regressed (i.e., gotten worse).

**5. Model Registry & Deployment**
Once a new model is trained and validated, this system manages its deployment. It would replace the old model in the live `Reasoner Service`, completing the loop.

### Conclusion

By implementing this cycle, we create an agent that doesn't just solve problems, but actively gets better at solving them over time. Its failures become lessons, and its successes become templates for future behavior.
